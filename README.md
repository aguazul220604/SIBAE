<h2>‚ö° Energy Balance System (SIBAE)</h2>

<p>
  <strong>SIBAE</strong> (<em>Sistema de Balance de Energ√≠a</em>) is a backend-driven platform developed for the <strong>Federal Electricity Commission (CFE)</strong>, specifically within the Department of Engineering, Connections, and Services.  
  The system was designed to automate critical energy balance and reporting processes that were previously managed manually, improving efficiency, accuracy, and operational visibility.
</p>

<h3>üèóÔ∏è Context</h3>
<p>
  Before SIBAE‚Äôs implementation, energy balance operations required manual data processing and validation, leading to frequent inconsistencies, delayed decision-making, and limited traceability.  
  The need for automation and reliability motivated the development of a centralized system capable of managing energy data in real time.
</p>

<h3>üíª Technical Overview</h3>
<p>
  SIBAE was built with <strong>Laravel</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>, using a modular architecture and event-driven backend logic.  
  Database triggers were implemented to automate core processes, ensuring data consistency and reducing human error.  
  The architecture was designed to be scalable, maintainable, and ready for future integrations with other CFE digital systems.
</p>

<h3>üîß Key Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Modular and scalable architecture built on <strong>Laravel</strong></li>
  <li>Automated energy calculations and validations via <strong>MySQL triggers</strong></li>
  <li>Role-based access control and audit-ready data management</li>
  <li>RESTful API structure for potential third-party integrations</li>
  <li>Scrum-based development with continuous communication with stakeholders</li>
</ul>

<h3>üöÄ Impact</h3>
<p>
  SIBAE streamlined critical workflows, reduced manual effort, and improved data reliability across the department.  
  The system established a technical foundation for future digital transformation initiatives and served as a reference model for automation within institutional energy management.
</p>

<h3>üë• Team & Methodology</h3>
<p>
  Led a multidisciplinary development team under the <strong>Scrum</strong> framework ‚Äî defining sprints, deliverables, and review sessions with CFE‚Äôs technical staff.  
  Contributed to backend architecture design, API development, functional testing, and technical documentation.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
